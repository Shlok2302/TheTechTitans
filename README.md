# TheTechTitans 🔐📁

TheTechTitans is a security-focused project that demonstrates secure file transmission using AES-256-GCM encryption along with a modern web-based frontend built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

This project highlights how encrypted data can be safely transmitted over a network while maintaining confidentiality and integrity.
